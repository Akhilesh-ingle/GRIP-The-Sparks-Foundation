# Tasks

## Task 1 - Predicting Using Supervised Machine Learning

In this task we will predict the percentage score that a student is expected to score based on the number of hours they studied. This task involves two variables, 'Hours' and 'Percentage' and this task will be done by using simple linear regression as it involves two variables only.
