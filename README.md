# About The Sparks Foundation

![](TSF.png)

[The Sparks Foundation](https://www.thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/) mission is to To inspire, motivate and encourage students to learn, create and help build a better society.To teach new ways of thinking, to innovate and solve the problems on their own.To let the students integrate, and help each other, learn from each other and do well together.

**Vission Statement:** A world of enabled and connected little minds, building future.
**Mission Statement:** To inspire students, help them innovate and let them integrate to build the next generation humankind.

# Tasks

## Task 1 - Predicting Using Supervised Machine Learning

In this task we will predict the percentage score that a student is expected to score based on the number of hours they studied. This task involves two variables, 'Hours' and 'Percentage' and this task will be done by using simple linear regression as it involves two variables only.

### Problem Statement:

  What will be the predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hours in a day?

## Task 2 - Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

In this task we will have to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. This task will be done by K-Means clustering.
